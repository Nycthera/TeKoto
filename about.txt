About this project, sources etc. 

So, firstly, the benefits about ASL (american sign language)
1. Whenever I need to gossip or rant, I can sign without the fear of getting eavesdropped on or caught. Of course, this doesn’t apply when I am talking about a deaf person; the secret is no longer secret!
2. When my friend is stuck on the opposite road with the Red Traffic Man appearing, it is easier to sign from afar to communicate, and trust me when I say it is much faster than a text.
3. When I am sick, with a bad cough, I can simply sign without needing to aggravate my poor hoarse voice further.
4. When I am in a noisy place with lots of background noise such as in the hawker centre, beside a busy road. 
5. I can’t hear my friends clearly (and even my voice) despite hearing aids (because these amplify all sounds in a somewhat degraded version with quite a lot of fidelity loss). Instead of killing my brain cells trying (uselessly) to strain to hear and speech-read which is mentally draining at times, using sign language is just so much easier!

1. Many people dont really get access to this less
